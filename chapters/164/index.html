3rd person POV
--------------

Evul'arth and Emban'arth are talking while Emban'arth is decorating bonfire cards with ink patterns. Evul is interested in Emban's visit to Stu'arth "grand demonstration" and her opinion of Alden Thorn. Evul is lounging on top of the table, borrowing Emban's brushes and painting on herself. Emban exresses an opinion that this behaviour coming from a "powerful hn'tyon" would shock Alden while she is not held to the same standard.

Evul is worried about Stu's relationship with Alden. Emban expected Alden to be special. Evul expresses an opinion that Stu might like Alden because Alden's life (as opposed to Stu's) would be free of danger. She formulates a plan to ensure Alden's safety by summoning him every day to "keep Red Alden company". Emban wonders what Stu's opinion of that will be.

Evul asks why Emban is decorating bonfire cards. Emban says that she plans to make hundreds of them. She just had her second affixation. Emban plans to present the cards to the Alis'arth's guests at the Summersending festival. She plans to explain to the guests that the cards express the importance of sacrifice. Evul says this will make the Summersending festival a miserable experience.
